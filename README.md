# Or Cohen

I am a quantitative researcher and portfolio manager. 

My areas of interest are the application of machine learning and neural networks in systematic trading, portfolio management, global macroeconomics, and factor investing.

I hold an MBA with a major in Finance (Magna Cum Laude) from [EDHEC Busniess School](https://www.edhec.edu/en) and a B.A. in Economics from the [University of Haifa](https://www.haifa.ac.il/?lang=en). Currently I read for the [CFA program](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfa-program) (passed Level 1). 

Previously, I have worked at [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/), [Pagaya](pagaya.com) and [Bank Leumi](https://english.leumi.co.il/WnnnWn/Company_Profile/38044/).
