# Or Cohen

I am a quantitative finance researcher and portfolio manager. 

My key area of interest is the application of machine learning and neural networks in systematic trading and portfolio management.

I hold an MBA with a major in Finance (Magna Cum Laude) from [EDHEC Busniess School](https://www.edhec.edu/en) and a B.A. in Economics from the [University of Haifa](https://www.haifa.ac.il/?lang=en). 

Previously, I have worked at [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/), [Pagaya](pagaya.com) and [Bank Leumi](https://english.leumi.co.il/WnnnWn/Company_Profile/38044/).
