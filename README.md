# Or Cohen

I am a quantitative finance researcher and emerging investment manager. 

My key area of interest is the application of neural networks and machine learning in portfolio management and systematic trading. I use this knowledge to craft data-driven tools for risk and portfolio management.


Previously, I have worked as an analyst at [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/), [Pagaya](pagaya.com) and [Bank Leumi](https://english.leumi.co.il/WnnnWn/Company_Profile/38044/).
